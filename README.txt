Just a good solid bare starter theme for WordPress that I keep tinkering with

03-13-12 ** Normalization **
	-I clearly always forget to edit this with updates. Anyways. Added normalize.css instead of reset.css.
12-27-11 ** Function Change **
	-Changed all instances of bloginfo() referencing the theme directory, to use get_template_directory_uri()
06-18-11 ** WordPress TwentyEleven Poke **
	-Compared and contrasted this theme with TwentyEleven. Borrowed things I liked from TwentyEleven.
06-06-11 ** Added Files **
    -A lot of file cleanup and indent touchup.
05-24-11 ** Added Files **
	-Added custom_cms_admin.php. Full of functions and information on customizing WordPress admin for clients.
